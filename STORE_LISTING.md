## Extension Name
Speech Information Rate Analyzer

## Short Description (132 characters max)
Real-time analysis of speech information rate (bits/second) using linguistic entropy calculations for research and education.

## Detailed Description

Analyze the information content of your speech in real-time! This extension measures how much linguistic information you convey per second using advanced entropy calculations.

**Perfect for:**
- Researchers studying speech patterns
- Public speakers optimizing their delivery
- Language learners analyzing fluency
- Educators teaching information theory
- Anyone curious about linguistic analysis

**Key Features:**
✅ Real-time speech transcription and analysis
✅ Information rate calculation (bits per second)
✅ Word-level entropy analysis using large corpora
✅ Beautiful, modern interface with live statistics
✅ Complete privacy - all processing happens locally
✅ No data collection or storage

**How it works:**
1. Click the extension icon and start recording
2. Speak naturally while the extension transcribes your speech
3. Watch real-time statistics including:
   - Live word count and duration
   - Average entropy per word
   - Information transmission rate
4. Stop recording to see final analysis results

**Technical Details:**
- Uses Web Speech API for accurate transcription
- Calculates entropy based on word frequency in large text corpora
- Applies Shannon information theory principles
- Supports continuous speech recognition
- Works entirely offline after initial corpus download

**Privacy First:**
- No personal data collected or stored
- All speech processing happens in your browser
- No external servers or data transmission
- Open source and transparent

Whether you're a researcher, educator, or just curious about the information content of speech, this tool provides fascinating insights into linguistic communication patterns.
