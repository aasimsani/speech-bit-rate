# Privacy Policy - Speech Information Rate Analyzer

**Last updated: December 2024**

## Overview

Speech Information Rate Analyzer ("the Extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how we handle information when you use our Chrome extension.

## Information We Collect

**We collect NO personal information.** Specifically:

- **No speech data is stored or transmitted** - All speech processing happens locally in your browser
- **No personal identifiers are collected** - We don't collect names, emails, or any identifying information
- **No usage analytics** - We don't track how you use the extension
- **No cookies or local storage** - The extension doesn't store any data on your device

## How the Extension Works

1. **Speech Recognition**: Uses your browser's built-in Web Speech API (provided by Google/Chrome)
2. **Text Analysis**: Processes transcribed text locally using mathematical calculations
3. **Corpus Data**: Downloads public word frequency data from external sources for analysis
4. **Results Display**: Shows calculations in real-time within the extension interface

## Data Sources

The extension downloads word frequency data from these public sources:
- Norvig's word frequency corpus (norvig.com)
- Google's 10,000 most common English words (GitHub)

This data is used only for linguistic analysis and is not combined with your speech data.

## Permissions

The extension requests these permissions:

- **Microphone Access**: Required for speech recognition (handled by browser's Web Speech API)
- **Active Tab**: Allows the extension to function as a popup
- **External Hosts**: Allows downloading public corpus data for analysis

## Third-Party Services

- **Web Speech API**: Your browser may send audio to Google's servers for speech recognition (this is handled by Chrome, not our extension)
- **Corpus Data Sources**: We download word frequency lists from public repositories

## Data Security

- All processing happens locally in your browser
- No data is transmitted to our servers (we don't have any servers)
- Speech data is processed in real-time and not stored

## Children's Privacy

This extension does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. The extension is designed for educational and research purposes.

## Changes to Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy occasionally. Any changes will be posted here with an updated date.
